# Overview

Project 1 of the course CAS FEE at HSR Rapperswil from Peter Fuerholz.

## Acknowledgement
This project was realized using different approaches so that we can later look up how you can do this in one or the
other fashion. Used "fashions":
* one layout done with floats, otherwise by means of flex
* jQuery is used but could be used more thoroughly


## Quick start
* Download / Clone this project and start node ('node server.js'). Open browser under said URL (http://127.0.0.1:3001).


## Specifc Features
* A note can be finished on the main page only. (That means the 'finished' property is set from this page, all other
  properties can be set on the edit page.
* The edited note is set by URL parameter. This has the advantage that an URL to a specific note can be saved and passed
  around (is bookmarkable). If a note cannot be found under set URL an error message is shown.

## Browser support
Tested with (????????)
* Chrome *(latest 2)*
* Firefox *(latest 2)*
* Safari *(latest 2)*
